         <p class="para">Hi!
             My name is Sara, and I'm a 16-year-old student at IT Gimnazija in Travnik,
              Bosnia and Herzegovina. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by technology and its ability to shape the world around us. That passion has led me to explore coding, and right now, I’m learning JavaScript and C++ both in school and through Mali Programer, where I love tackling challenges and discovering new ways to solve problems.
           Beyond coding, I have a background in judo, a sport that taught me discipline, perseverance, and strategic thinking—skills that I now bring into my approach to programming and problem-solving. I also enjoy spending time with my little brother, balancing my academic pursuits with family life, and embracing the joy of learning and growing together.
I see programming not just as a skill but as a way to build, create, and innovate. Whether it’s writing code that makes life easier, developing projects that push boundaries, or simply understanding how technology works, I am always eager to learn more. My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge, refining my abilities, and contributing to the dynamic world of technology in meaningful ways.
